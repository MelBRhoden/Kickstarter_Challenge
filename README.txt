# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
-Import data into a table for analysis
-Apply filters, conditional formatting, and formulas. 
-Calculate summary statistics 
-Characterize data on datasets
-Perform an Excel analysis with visualizations
-Interpret common Excel visualization 

### Purpose
	An Analysis of the Kickstarter data was conducted to assist with a client to determine the timing and fundraising goals for a play. 
From the original analysis it was determined that launch dates and goals were strongly influenced of successful outcomes. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	The client has a large interest in theater. This graph shows the data filtered by category. This graph shows that the number of live outcomes were far greater. 















### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	The client’s main interest is theater and more or so the subcategory of plays. So therefore, the data was filtered again to show this interest. The goals were then put into groups of $5000. Then the total number of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes were calculated and converted to percentages. 





### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	The percentage of canceled projects had all zeros, which could possibly indicate a formula error. After reviewing the raw data, it was confirmed that all information is correct.



## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The best months to launch a successful theater project are May and June
	2. There are very few canceled theater projects 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	From the graph the most successful percentages of outcomes were those that had a goal of less than $5000.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	There is limited data on canceled theater projects and no examples of examples of plays canceled in subcategories. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
